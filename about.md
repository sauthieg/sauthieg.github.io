My name is **Guillaume Sauthier**, I'm [OpenIG][ig] Lead Developer at [ForgeRock][forgerock].

I've been in the middleware Open Source business since 2003, when I entered Bull
to work on [OW2 JOnAS][jonas].

That was the beginning of the Opensource adventure for me: JOnAS was using
[Apache Axis][axis] so naturally I contributed back to the project, participating
on the mailing lists, fixing bugs, ... Project leaders even invited me to
become an Apache committer :)

During the 2005 year, the JOnAS team decided to move the entire codebase to [OSGi][osgi],
that would help maintenance, provide better re-usability, enhance code quality.

I had quite a fun with all the needed refactoring, componentization problems
and classloading issues!

In order to achieve that goal, I invested a lot of time and energy in the
[Apache Felix][felix] project (an opensource OSGi framework implementation), and
especially in the [iPOJO][ipojo] subproject that aims to facilitate building
modular and dynamic applications with the help of managed components. I was
again rewarded with a new project committer-ship.

I have also been part of a technology startup called *Peergreen* focusing on
Java PaaS, still using OSGi and iPOJO to build an application platform.

Since 2014, I'm part of [ForgeRock][forgerock] where we work on identity management and security.
