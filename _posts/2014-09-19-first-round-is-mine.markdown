# Wow,
... this is my very first blog post for years !!!

I'm usually more a tech reader than a tech writer, but I feel that it is time
to start sharing on technology.

<!-- more -->

The easier for me to start with is using the open source project I'm working on
as a source of inspiration :)

I want to begin with some introduction on [OpenIG](http://openig.forgerock.org):
what is it, picturing some use cases and mostly focusing on tips and tricks.

I hope you'll appreciate.

Cheers!
